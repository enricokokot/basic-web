During my time as a *mobile app developer intern at Lloyds Digital* I was given the task to learn as much of the technologies they use as I can in the month that was given to me. I worked with **React Native**, **TypeScript**, MobX-State-Tree, React Query and other tools and libraries in order to create a simple multi-page mobile application for tracking cryptocurrency prices and market volume.

I led a five person team concerned with population statistics in Croatia for the *Statistics* class. We graphically presented numbers concerning different aspects of our society including religiousness, minorities and centralization through history using **Python**.

I worked in a team of four on a database project  for the *Databases 1* class in college. The goal of the project was to create a basic working model of a country's healthcare system and associated documentation to test our knowledge in **MySQL**. I was responsible for devising and creating 80% of the queries and helped edit the documentation.

I took on the team leading role for the *Chatbot in the Office* presentation for the college class *Office Work Computerization* . My responsibilities consisted of deciding on the game plan, monitoring the whole development of the presentation side and creating a simple chatbot using **Bot Framework Composer** and **C#**.
